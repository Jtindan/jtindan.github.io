I am an early-career research scientist with interests in mineral dust variability, dust–climate interactions, air quality, and large-scale atmospheric dynamics. I am currently a PhD candidate in Meteorology and Atmospheric Science at The Pennsylvania State University, expecting to graduate in summer 2026. My PhD research evaluates Saharan dust aerosols during the historical period (1981–2010) using WRF-Chem and examines their dynamical impacts on the African Easterly Jet and African Easterly Waves.

I received my MS degree in Atmospheric Science from the University of Kansas in 2022 under the supervision of [Dr. Bing Pu](https://geog.ku.edu/people/bing-pu). My master’s research focused on the diurnal variability of dust aerosols over North Africa, the Middle East, and East Asia using satellite, reanalysis, and in situ observations. This work has been published in high-impact journals, including Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics and Science of the Total Environment, and was recognized with the [Outstanding Master's Thesis Award](https://coga.ku.edu/for-students/awards-funding/master-thesis) by the KU College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

Broadly, my research aims to improve understanding of dust–climate interactions and their implications for air quality, regional circulation, and tropical cyclone development. I am particularly interested in convective processes that facilitate dust uplift. I seek collaborative opportunities in regional and global climate variability, data assimilation, and Earth system modeling, and I have extensive experience working with large climate datasets and computational workflows. 

Outside of research, I enjoy playing soccer and board games, including traditional Ghanaian games such as oware and ludo. I train regularly in the gym, enjoy cooking, and value spending time with family and friends.
